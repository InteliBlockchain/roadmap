Welcome to the _Inteli Blockchain Roadmap_!

### Why this book exists
This book started with a course, and became a unique experience. Written by two lazy university students who love tecnology and are tired of so much bullshit in tech...
// TODO: finish

### Who is for
The reader should have some previous experience developing computer programs, this book doesn't start from absolutely zero, and it's important that you have some knowledge of what are variables, control flows, functions, conditionals, etc.
</br>

Mathematics isn't a major topic of this book, but to surprise you, computers speak's math, and we'll use many mathematical notations to prove certain propositions or demonstrate ideas.

</br>
However, in general, this was meant for:

- Programmers that want to be good.
- Any curious mf.

### Goals
This book was written with one goal in mind, which is:

- Turn the reader into a stinking nerd

### How to use this book
The book assumes you're reading it in sequence from front to back. Later chapters build on concepts from earlier chapters, and chapters might not delve into profound details on a particular topic, but will always try to keep references to them.
</br>
As a general guideline, here's some pragmatic advice on how to use this content:

- Read the book at your own pace.
- It is highly incentivised for the reader to search way beyond what the book has to offer.
- Be open-minded, free yourself from any closed paradigm (objects are just data structures, don't treat them as religion).
- Have fun.
